# Pomodoro-Timer

I created this app as a part of 100 days of code challenge.
At first this was just a python file,but then I converted it into an executable for my friends and family.

It's a simple timer app for doing anything.It reminds you to take breaks after a certain time interval to prevent stressing yourself out.
It rewards you with a longer break,if you complete a cycle of 4 workout sessions (i.e.,every 4th break is a "long break").

It is functional as it is,but i would surely like to improve its UI, but I don't know how to do it in Python😅.
Will learn and update soon....😁

Since it's an executable file,you can download and use it.
Just download the folder and run the 'main.exe' file.
